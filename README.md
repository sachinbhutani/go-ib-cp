## X509 Certificate error 

Please refer to the interactive brokers CP Web gateway FAQq in common question section at 
https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/faq.html

> Since the gateway is running on your premises the certificate needs to be created/self-signed by you, or officially signed by a 3rd party. The gateway is similar to another webserver such as Tomcat which doesnâ€™t provide a certificate along with the release.
